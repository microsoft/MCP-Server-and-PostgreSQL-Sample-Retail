# Azure Developer CLI (azd) Quick Start

## üöÄ Deploy with Azure Developer CLI

This project is now fully compatible with Azure Developer CLI (azd) for automated deployment of both infrastructure and the MCP server application.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Azure Developer CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Windows (winget)
   winget install microsoft.azurecli
   winget install Microsoft.AzureDeveloperCLI
   
   # macOS (brew)
   brew install azure-cli
   brew install azd
   
   # Linux
   curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Login to Azure**:
   ```bash
   az login
   azd auth login
   ```

### üéØ One-Command Deployment

```bash
# Navigate to azd folder
cd azd

# Initialize new environment (first time only)
azd env new <your-environment-name>

# Set your preferred Azure location
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION westus2

# Deploy everything (infrastructure + application)
azd up
```

### üîß Development Workflow

```bash
# Deploy only infrastructure changes
azd provision

# Deploy only application changes  
azd deploy

# View deployed resources
azd show

# View environment variables
azd env get-values

# Clean up all resources
azd down
```

### üì¶ What Gets Deployed

#### **Infrastructure**
- Resource Group
- Log Analytics Workspace  
- Application Insights
- Azure AI Services (with OpenAI models)
- Container App Environment

#### **Application**
- MCP Server (Container App)
- Health monitoring enabled
- Environment variables configured
- Application Insights integration

### üåç Environment Variables

After deployment, these variables are automatically available:

```bash
AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP       # Resource group name
AZURE_LOCATION             # Deployment region
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT      # AI Services endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY       # AI Services key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME # GPT model name
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME # Embedding model name
APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING  # Monitoring connection
```

### üîç Monitoring & Management

- **Azure Portal**: View all resources in your resource group
- **Application Insights**: Monitor application performance and logs
- **Container Apps**: View application logs and metrics
- **AI Studio**: Manage OpenAI model deployments

### üìã Troubleshooting

#### **Common Issues**

1. **Location not supported**:
   ```bash
   azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus2
   ```

2. **Resource quotas exceeded**:
   - Check your subscription limits in Azure Portal
   - Try a different region

3. **Authentication issues**:
   ```bash
   azd auth login --use-device-code
   ```

4. **View deployment logs**:
   ```bash
   azd show --output json
   ```

### üîÑ Alternative: Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment, you can still use the infrastructure in the `/infra` folder:

```bash
cd ../infra
./deploy.ps1  # Windows
./deploy.sh   # macOS/Linux
```
