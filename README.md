# Sales Analysis MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive customer sales database access for Zava Retail DIY Business. This server enables AI assistants to query and analyze retail sales data through a secure, schema-aware interface.

## Prerequisites

1. Docker Desktop installed
2. Git installed
3. **Azure CLI**: Install and authenticate with Azure CLI
4. Access to OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` model and optionally `gpt-4o-mini` model.

## Getting Started

Open a terminal window and running the following commands:

1. Authenticate with Azure CLI

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

2. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gloveboxes/Zava-MCP-Server-and-PostgreSQL-Sample
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory

    ```bash
    cd Zava-MCP-Server-and-PostgreSQL-Sample
    ```

### Deploy Azure Resources

Run the following scripts to automate the deployment of Azure resources needed for the MCP server.

The deployment scripts will automatically deploy the `text-embedding-3-small` model. During deployment, you'll have the option to also include the `gpt-4o-mini` model. Note that `gpt-4o-mini` is **not required** for this project and is only included for potential future enhancements.

**Choose the script for your platform:**

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Run from the project root directory
cd infra && ./deploy.ps1
```

#### macOS/Linux (Bash)

```bash
# Run from the project root directory
cd infra && ./deploy.sh
```

## Running the MCP Server

The easiest way to run the complete stack (PostgreSQL + MCP Server) is using Docker Compose:

### Start the Stack

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL and MCP Server
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# View MCP Server Logs
docker compose logs -f mcp_server

# View the PostgreSQL Logs
docker compose logs -f pg17

# Stop the stack
docker compose down -v
```

## Usage

The following assumes you'll be using the built-in VS Code MCP server support.

1. Open the project in VS Code. From the terminal, run:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

2. Start one or more MCP servers using the configurations in `.vscode/mcp.json`. The file contains four different server configurations, each representing a different store manager role:

   - Each configuration uses a unique RLS (Row Level Security) user ID
   - These user IDs simulate different store manager identities accessing the database
   - The RLS system restricts data access based on the manager's assigned store
   - This mimics real-world scenarios where store managers sign in with different Entra ID accounts

    ```json
    {
        "servers": {
            "zava-sales-analysis-headoffice": {

Perform a semantic search for products based on user queries.

**Returns:** A list of products matching the search criteria

**Parameters:**

- `query` (str): The search query string

**Returns:** A list of products matching the search criteria

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

The server implements Row Level Security to ensure users only access data they're authorized to view:

- **HTTP Mode**: Uses `x-rls-user-id` header to identify the requesting user

- **Default Fallback**: Uses placeholder UUID when no user ID is provided

#### Store-Specific RLS User IDs

Each Zava Retail store location has a unique RLS user ID that determines which data the user can access:

| Store Location | RLS User ID | Description |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Global Access** | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` | Default fallback - all store access |
| **Seattle** | `f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479` | Zava Retail Seattle store data |
| **Bellevue** | `6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8` | Zava Retail Bellevue store data |
| **Tacoma** | `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890` | Zava Retail Tacoma store data |
| **Spokane** | `d8e9f0a1-b2c3-4567-8901-234567890abc` | Zava Retail Spokane store data |
| **Everett** | `3b9ac9fa-cd5e-4b92-a7f2-b8c1d0e9f2a3` | Zava Retail Everett store data |
| **Redmond** | `e7f8a9b0-c1d2-3e4f-5678-90abcdef1234` | Zava Retail Redmond store data |
| **Kirkland** | `9c8b7a65-4321-fed0-9876-543210fedcba` | Zava Retail Kirkland store data |
| **Online** | `2f4e6d8c-1a3b-5c7e-9f0a-b2d4f6e8c0a2` | Zava Retail Online store data |

#### RLS Implementation

When a user connects with a specific store's RLS User ID, they will only see:

- Customers associated with that store
- Orders placed at that store location
- Inventory data for that specific store
- Store-specific sales and performance metrics

This ensures data isolation between different store locations while maintaining a unified database schema.

## Architecture

### Application Context

The server uses a managed application context with:

- **Database Connection Pool**: Efficient connection management for HTTP mode
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper resource cleanup on shutdown
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed context with `AppContext` dataclass

### Request Context

- **Header Extraction**: Secure header parsing for user identification
- **RLS Integration**: Automatic user ID resolution from request context
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Database Integration

The server integrates with a PostgreSQL database through the `PostgreSQLSchemaProvider` class:

- **Connection Pooling**: Uses async connection pools for scalability
- **Schema Metadata**: Provides detailed table schema information
- **Query Execution**: Secure query execution with RLS support
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of database resources

## Error Handling

The server implements robust error handling:

- **Table Validation**: Ensures only valid table names are accessed
- **Query Validation**: Validates PostgreSQL queries before execution
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup even during errors
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security**: All queries respect RLS policies based on user identity
2. **Store Data Isolation**: Each store's RLS User ID ensures access only to that store's data
3. **Input Validation**: Table names and queries are validated before execution
4. **Resource Limits**: Query results are limited to prevent excessive resource usage
5. **Connection Security**: Uses secure database connection practices
6. **User Identity Verification**: Always ensure the correct RLS User ID is used for the intended store location

### Important Security Notes

- **Never use production RLS User IDs in development environments**
- **Always verify the RLS User ID matches the intended store before running queries**
- **The default UUID (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`) provides limited access**
- **Each store manager should only have access to their store's RLS User ID**
