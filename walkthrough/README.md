# üöÄ MCP Server with PostgreSQL - Complete Learning Guide

## üß† Overview of the MCP Database Integration Learning Path

This comprehensive learning guide teaches you how to build production-ready **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** that integrate with databases through a practical retail analytics implementation. You'll learn enterprise-grade patterns including **Row Level Security (RLS)**, **semantic search**, **Azure AI integration**, and **multi-tenant data access**.

Whether you're a backend developer, AI engineer, or data architect, this guide provides structured learning with real-world examples and hands-on exercises.
